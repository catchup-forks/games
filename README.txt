Welcome to the Basic Pages application for Garden & Vanilla Forums!

Basic Pages is an application that provides a way for you to create basic public pages for static content in Garden.

/**
 * INSTALLATION STEPS
 */
1. Extract the "/basicpages" directory in this archive to the "/applications" directory of your Vanilla forum installation.
2. Go to the admin dashboard applications page and enable the Basic Pages application.
3. Check out the settings for the Basics Pages application and create a new page from there.

/**
 * BRIEF OVERVIEW
 */
Anyone who has permission to manage the admin dashboard will be able to create, edit, and delete pages.

Pages are prefixed with the "/page" namespace and you can enable
a setting that will route a page to the root directory.

You can also show a link in the header site menu for the page.

The page body editor uses the same format and editor plugin that
you have installed as with the other official applications.
